# Art Puzzle

## Stage

Development (Core Features)

## Concept

A simple themed puzzle game that uses artworks from the Art Institute of Chicago's public API.

## Motivation

Current existing puzzle web applications tend to be subpar experiences, as they attempt to replicate real-life puzzles without questioning how certain aspects of the game translate in digital. A short qualitative analysis identified two core problems with most puzzle web apps:
- clunky drag-drop UX;
- outdated or unresolved website designs.

The Art Puzzle app solves the former UX problem by taking a more pleasant click-click approach for both touchpad and mouse users on PCs. 
A mobile port is currently not under development but under consideration.

By curating collections of classical artworks in a minimalist interface, the game retains an opinionated but unified aesthetic that other applications fail to achieve.
