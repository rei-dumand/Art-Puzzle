# Art Puzzle

## Stage

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## Concept

A simple puzzle game that uses images of paintings from a free museum API as its base game material.

## Constraints

- This should be a full stack CRUD application.
- The game should operate like a puzzle game.
- Since it is only aimed to be deployed as a desktop-first web application, it should consider how players could play with just keyboard inputs.
- The web application should allow for secure user registration.
- A puzzle should be saved even if incomplete, so that a user can resume at a later session.
- The game should have multiple levels of difficulties.

## Deliverables

- A GitHub repository.
- A presentation slides deck.

## Stack (provisional)

## Motivation

- This project is a stepping stone in learning how to create interactive web experiences.
- One key feature that will be explored will be the use of a <Canvas>.
- This game will also make extensive use of a database to store a user's progress. A socket connection might be considered.
